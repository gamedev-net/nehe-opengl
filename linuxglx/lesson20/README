Readme for NeHe's OpenGL Tutorial Lesson20 Linux/GLX port
==========================================================

Compilation:

make

Running:

./lesson20

Requirements:

- OpenGL headers and libraries 
- Xserver with GLX and XF86VidMode extensions (I used version 4.0.1)
- gcc (any other ANSI C compiler should do it too; I used gcc 2.95.2)

Known bugs/issues:

- does not stop drawing even if iconified (though it is not visible)
- does not explicitly select color depth
