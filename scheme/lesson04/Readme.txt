This distribution is a collection of Jeff Molofee's excellent OpenGL tutorials ported to Scheme.  It is distributed source-only for the sake of portability.  You will need DrScheme version 205 along with SGL and MrEd in order to run these programs; all of these can be found at http://www.plt-scheme.org/.
