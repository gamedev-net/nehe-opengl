This Code is based on NeHe's TUtorial.
It's no 1:1 conversion, some things are slightly different.

I used Visual Studio .NET for drawing up this code.
For compiling the code you need the CsGL Basecode which is attached. 
(You find the dll in the file CsGL Basecode)
If this doesn't work, you should also copy the csgl.dll in your system32 file.

Hope this code is useful to anyone.
So, if you have any questions, comments or improvements just let me know.
